## Abstract

Traditional network defense strategies, which follow a linear sequence of vulnerability discovery, defense selection, and attack mitigation, often struggle to adapt to emerging and unpredictable cyber threats. This paper introduces a novel strategic framework designed to optimize defense costs that addresses security concerns and cost-effectiveness. Drawing inspiration from Bayesian Stackelberg game theory, our approach introduces a novel resource management strategy. We test our approach over the programmable networking paradigm, which is already expected to expand traditional network architectures to ease the management of new properties, including the incorporation of new security functionality. We conduct experimental work assuming a representative setup over Software Defined Networking protocols. We show that our solution outperforms existing methods by reducing defense costs and offering defenders the flexibility to minimize the attack's impact or the overall cost. Our work establishes a foundation for developing advanced models with more detailed representations of system resources.
